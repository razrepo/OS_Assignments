Part 1: q1p1
This program prints 4 statements in the following order
A) Parent (P) is having ID 40732
C) Child is having ID 40734
D) My Parent ID is 40732
B) ID of P's Child is 40734

This is achieved by printing the PARENT PID first and then the CHILD process
and post that making the PARENT process wait until thE CHILD process is over
and then prints statement B.

Part 2: q1p2
This program has two processes:
1. The PARENT process that prints the first 16 numbers in the fibonacci sequence 
2. The CHILD process that prints the factorial of 4

In this part, the PARENT waits for the CHILD to finish execution
This is achieved by a process similar to Part 1, by adding a "wait()"
prior to the PARENT process's execution.

Part 3: q1p2 BONUS
This program has the same processes as Part 2 but the opposite order of exexution
for the CHILD waits for the PARENT to finish executing.

This is achieved by using the "wait()" in the CHILD process's iteration instead 
of the PARENT's. This makes the CHILD process wait until the PARENT process is over.
